- Ticket 24: If a name is not known by LibTourist, IsZone will no longer return True.

- Ticket 23: A new zone type has been introduced: InstanceCluster. An InstanceCluster is still considered to be a zone (and not an instance or a transport) but can now be distinguished.
Any old entrance portal coordinates for these zones have been removed, as they aren't instances.

Affected zones: Blackrock Mountain, Scarlet Monastery, Caverns of Time, Hellfire Citadel, Coilfang Reservoir, Ring of Observance, Tempest Keep, Coldarra and Anh'Qiraj: The Fallen Kingdom.

- API: GetType(<zone>) will now return "InstanceCluster" for these zones.
- API: Added function IsInstanceCluster(<zone>)
- API: Added function IterateInstanceClusters
